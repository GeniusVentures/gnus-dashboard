      </p>

        We take content moderation seriously to ensure a safe and respectful
        environment for all users of Funding Chain. As part of our efforts, we
        employ an AI model to detect the possibility of overly sexual photos.
        However, please note that the AI model may occasionally flag innocent
        photos as potentially being too sexual. We apologize for any
        inconvenience or confusion this may cause and assure you that our team
        can manually review flagged content to make fair and accurate
        determinations. If you believe your photo needs to be manually reviwed,
        you can find the ways to contact us below in the "Contact Information"
        section.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage users to report any inappropriate or offensive content that
        they come across while using Funding Chain. Your reports help us
        maintain the integrity of our platform and take appropriate actions as
        necessary.
      </p>
      <h4>Permanence of Blockchain Transactions</h4>
      <p>
        One of the fundamental characteristics of blockchain technology is the
        immutability and permanence of transactions. Once a transaction is
        recorded on a blockchain, it becomes a permanent part of the ledger and
        cannot be undone, reversed, or refunded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures that
        transactions are validated and recorded by multiple participants in a
        network. These transactions are bundled into blocks and linked together
        in a chronological order, forming an unchangeable chain of data. This
        immutability provides transparency and security, making it extremely
        difficult for any malicious or unauthorized entity to alter or tamper
        with the recorded transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to understand that this permanence extends to
        transactions made through our app as well. Once a transaction is
        initiated and recorded on the blockchain, it becomes a permanent and
        verifiable entry. Therefore, it is crucial to double-check all
        transaction details, including the recipient's address and the amount,
        before confirming a transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly advise users to exercise caution and due diligence when
        making transactions on the blockchain. It is essential to verify the
        accuracy of the information and ensure that the intended recipient's
        address is correct. Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be
        reversed or refunded, as there is no central authority or intermediary
        to facilitate such processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend users to familiarize themselves with the necessary
        precautions and best practices for conducting transactions on the
        blockchain. By understanding and adhering to these guidelines, users can
        make informed decisions and minimize the risk of unintended or
        irreversible transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Funding Chain app is a decentralized platform where individuals
        raise money on behalf of themselves, an organization, or a company.
        While the platform strives to ensure the legitimacy of campaigns and
        projects, it is essential for users to independently verify the
        authenticity and credibility of the Funding Chain and the specific
        campaign they are considering supporting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, users should also exercise caution when evaluating the
        recipient of the funds raised on the Funding Chain platform. Whether it
        is an individual, organization, or company, users should investigate
        their background, intentions, and the purpose for which the funds will
        be used. Verifying the recipient's identity verification status,
        credibility, financial stability, and adherence to legal and ethical
        standards can contribute to a more informed decision about supporting
        their cause. We recommend only contributing to Funding Chains that were
        created by verified users.
      </p>
      <h4>Contributions and Equity</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Contributions to Funding Chain:</strong> By participating in a
          Funding Chain on our platform, you acknowledge and agree that any
          contributions you make, whether monetary or otherwise, are voluntary
          and do not entitle you to any equity, ownership rights, or shares in
          the funded project or any associated entities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Equity or Ownership Rights:</strong> Making contributions
          to a Funding Chain does not confer any ownership interest, equity
          stake, or shareholder rights in the project or any related ventures.
          Your contributions are solely meant to support the development,
          promotion, or realization of the project as outlined in the Funding
          Chain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Understanding the Nature of Contributions:</strong> It is
          essential to understand that your contributions to a Funding Chain are
          considered donations or support, and they are not equivalent to
          purchasing equity or shares in a business or project. The purpose of a
          Funding Chain is to gather financial support from the community to
          fund a project, without the expectation of receiving equity in return.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alternative Investment Options:</strong> If you are interested
          in obtaining equity or ownership rights in a project, we recommend
          exploring other investment opportunities, such as equity crowdfunding
          or direct investment, where the terms and conditions for obtaining
          equity are explicitly outlined.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Guarantee of Project Success or Returns:</strong>{" "}
          Participating in a Funding Chain does not guarantee the success,
          completion, or profitability of the project. The funds contributed by
          participants may be used for various project-related expenses, and
          there is no assurance of any financial returns or benefits resulting
          from your contribution.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns regarding your rights or the
        nature of your contributions, we strongly encourage you to seek
        independent legal advice before participating in a Funding Chain.
      </p>
      <h4>Compliance with KYC Reporting Requirements</h4>
      <p>
        Funding Chain is committed to complying with Know Your Customer (KYC)
        reporting requirements. As a user of the app, you agree to provide
        accurate and up-to-date information for KYC purposes. We may request
        additional information and documentation to verify your identity and
        comply with applicable laws and regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failure to provide accurate and complete KYC information may result in
        limitations on your account, including the inability to send or receive
        funds.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to upholding the highest standards of legal and
        regulatory compliance. As part of our dedication to maintaining a safe
        and secure environment, we will diligently follow all reporting
        requirements that are mandated by applicable laws and regulations. This
        includes but is not limited to reporting any suspicious activity, as
        well as fulfilling our obligations related to Know Your Customer (KYC)
        reporting.
      </p>
      <h4>Tax Deductibility of Contributions</h4>
      <p>
        It is important to note that contributions made through this app are not
        tax-deductible. The app is designed to enable individuals to raise money
        on behalf of themselves, an organization, or a company. As such, any
        funds contributed through the app do not qualify for tax deductions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking to make a tax-deductible donation, we recommend
        donating directly to a tax-exempt charity or organization. These
        organizations have the necessary legal status to provide tax deductions
        for donations made to them. By donating directly to a tax-exempt
        charity, you can ensure that your contribution is eligible for any
        applicable tax benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        While contributions made through this app are not tax deductible, they
        still play a crucial role in supporting individuals, organizations, and
        companies in achieving their goals. Your generosity and support are
        greatly appreciated, even without the tax benefits.
