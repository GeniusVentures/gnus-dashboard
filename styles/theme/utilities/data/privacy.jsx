      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy governs the privacy practices of the Funding Chain
        application owned by Decentralized Ventures, LLC. We are committed to
        protecting your privacy and providing transparency about how we handle
        your information.
      </p>

      <h4>Information Collected</h4>
      <p>We collect the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Email Address: We collect users' email addresses when they sign up for
          an account or provide it voluntarily. We use this information to
          communicate with users and send important updates related to their
          account or the Funding Chain service.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Photo Identification: To comply with identification verification
          requirements and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, we collect and
          store users' photo identifications, including a valid
          government-issued photo ID. We handle this information in accordance
          with applicable laws and regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transaction History: We collect information about users' transaction
          history on the Funding Chain platform, including details such as the
          amount, date, and purpose of each transaction. Note that transactions
          conducted on public blockchain networks are publicly visible to all
          participants.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When a user creates a Funding Chain, certain information may be
        displayed publicly, including the user's name and profile picture if
        provided. This information is visible to other users or visitors of the
        Funding Chain application.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take appropriate measures to protect the security and confidentiality
        of the collected information. For more details on how we handle and
        safeguard your data, please refer to the "Data Security" section of this
        Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h4>Data Sharing</h4>
      <p>
        While our general policy is not to share user data with third parties,
        we want to be transparent about certain exceptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Legal Authorities: In some situations, we may be obligated to release
          user data to legal authorities. This includes instances where a court
          order or legal process requires the disclosure of information. We are
          committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This exception is limited to legal and regulatory requirements and does
        not involve the sale, rental, or unauthorized sharing of user
        information. We prioritize the security and privacy of our users and
        will only disclose information when legally compelled to do so.
      </p>

      <h4>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h4>
      <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Access Token Backup: Cookies are used to store and retrieve access
          tokens with encoded user data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cookie Notice: Cookies are used to store the state of the cookie
          notice, ensuring that it is displayed appropriately to users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pending Chain Backup: Cookies are used to create a backup of a users'
          incomplete creation of a new Funding Chain smart contract.
        </li>
        <li>
          reCaptcha v2 by Google: To enhance security and prevent automated
          access, Funding Chain utilizes reCaptcha v2. Google may add cookies as
          part of reCaptcha. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for
          information on how reCaptcha data is handled.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please note that our cookies are not used for collecting personal data
        or tracking user behavior for advertising purposes.
      </p>
      <h4>Data Security</h4>
      <p>
        We take paramount measures to safeguard user data, employing the latest
        technologies to ensure the highest level of security. Specifically, our
        approach includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Encryption: All data, including sensitive information like private
          keys and photo identification, is encrypted to guarantee its security
          during both storage and transmission.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sharding Private Keys: To enhance the security of private keys, we
          utilize sharding technology. Sharding involves the partitioning of
          private keys into smaller, more manageable pieces, distributed across
          different secure locations. This adds an extra layer of protection
          against unauthorized access and potential breaches.
        </li>
        <li>
          Safeguarding: We implement industry-standard security protocols and
          safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration
          of your information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our commitment is to continually adopt and integrate the most advanced
        security measures to protect user data effectively.
      </p>
      <h4>Public Nature of Blockchain Transactions</h4>
      <p>
        Given the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, it's essential
        to note that transactions conducted on public blockchain networks are
        inherently public. This means that certain details, including Ethereum
        addresses and transaction amounts, are visible to all participants on
        the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you engage in transactions on Funding Chain, please be aware that
        the information related to these transactions may be accessible by other
        users or third parties. This transparency is a fundamental
        characteristic of blockchain technology and contributes to the integrity
        and security of the decentralized ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we implement stringent measures to protect your data within the
        Funding Chain application, it's important to exercise caution and avoid
        including sensitive or personally identifiable information in
        transaction details.
      </p>

      <h4>Use of IPFS for Picture Storage</h4>
      <p>
        Funding Chain utilizes the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for storing
        pictures uploaded by users. IPFS is a decentralized and distributed file
        system that allows for the storage and retrieval of files in a
        peer-to-peer network. Please note that when you upload pictures to
        Funding Chain, they are stored on IPFS, which is a public network
        accessible by other IPFS users.
      </p>
      <p>
        While IPFS provides a robust and efficient means of storing and sharing
        files, it's important to be aware that the nature of IPFS means that
        files stored on the network may be accessible by others. Funding Chain
        takes measures to maintain the privacy and security of user data, but we
        cannot guarantee the confidentiality of pictures stored on IPFS.
        Therefore, we recommend exercising caution when uploading pictures and
        avoiding the inclusion of sensitive or personal information in uploaded
        images.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using Funding Chain and uploading pictures, you acknowledge and
        accept that the uploaded pictures will be stored on IPFS and may be
        accessible by other IPFS users. Funding Chain disclaims any
        responsibility or liability for the privacy, security, or use of
        pictures stored on IPFS.
      </p>

      <h4>Internet Protocol Address Tracking</h4>
      <p>
        We may collect and track the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of users
        when they interact with the Funding Chain application. This includes
        activities such as signing in to the platform, completing transactions,
        and viewing individual Funding Chains. IP addresses are used for system
        administration, detecting and preventing fraudulent activities,
        analyzing trends, and gathering demographic information. Please note
        that IP addresses are generally considered non-personally identifiable
        information and do not reveal your specific identity
      </p>

      <h4>User Rights</h4>
      <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
